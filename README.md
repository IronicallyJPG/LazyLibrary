# LazyLibrary
A Java Library Implementing Features I use or would find useful at some point.<br/>
Making it as I learn more and more about the language.<br/>
CURRENT COMPILED VERSION: 1.8.0 (NEW SOURCE INCLUDED!)<br/>
CURRENT RAW      VERSION: 1.8.*<br/>
Trouble Understanding?<br/>
LL.java Houses Everything.<br/>
The LL*insert letter* Are 'Extensions' that are Objects Holding all the actual functions the LazyLibrary uses.<br/>
 | LLIO - houses all the code neccessary to work with basic *IO*. LL has a method that simply acts to make it more accessible.<br/>
 | LLE  - Basic *Encryption* ideas, not complete <br/>
 | LLD  - Time/*Date* Functions <br/>
 | LLM  - Will House *Math* Functions <br/>
 | LLN  - *Network*, in progress! <br/>
 | LLS  -  A *Sound* Tool, Capable of loading and playing sound! Thanks to: <a href="https://github.com/RalleYTN/SimpleAudio/wiki/Playing-audio">SimpleAudio</a>  <br/>
