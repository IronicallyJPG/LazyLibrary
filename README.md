# LazyLibrary
A Java Library Implementing Features I use or would find useful at some point.
Making it as I learn more and more about the language.
CURRENT VERSION: 1.5.2

Trouble Understanding?
LL.java Houses Everything.
The LL*insert letter* Are 'Extensions' that are Objects Holding all the actual functions LL uses.
 | LLIO - houses all the code neccessary to work with basic *IO*. LL has a method that simply acts to make it more accessible.
 | LLE  - Does not do Anything right now :(
 | LLD  - Time/*D*ate Functions
 | LLM  - Will House *M*ath Functions
 | LLN  - *N*etwork, also not done :(
 | LLS  -  A Special *S*ound Object that is extending Thread. It takes internal sound files (When given the path), and plays them         
  without interrupting the main Thread.
